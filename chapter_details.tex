\section{Propagation Model}
\section{Analog Filters}
results of filters on different kind of noise: simulated and real
\section{TDC-based Approaches}
walk error - amplitude, compare with analytical results
compare look up table between real and simulate relation
results w/o fitlers and results after filter
error for different methods
\section{ADC-based Approaches}
\subsection{Benchmark detector}
pw variance with SNR
error vs SNR, pfa and pd vs SNR, ROC, 
different noises on error, pfa, pd ...
measurements on real data
\subsection{Neyman-Pearson detector}

error vs SNR, pfa and pd vs SNR, ROC, 
different noises on error, pfa, pd ...
pfa and pd for diferent amp: pfa not affect, pd decreases
measurements on real data
\subsection{Comparison of detectors}
time cost, adv and disadv for different situations
